I enjoy learning by experimenting and building small pieces of software that help me understand the bigger concepts. I work best with clear structure, good documentation, and workflows that are easy to maintain. I’m also studying how AI works and how to use good engineering practices around it — from clean architecture to CI/CD and integrated testing.

I’m currently looking for my first junior developer opportunity, where I can apply what I’m learning, grow through real-world practice, and contribute to a team that values clarity and continuous improvement.
