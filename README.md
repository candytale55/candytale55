Hello there! 😁

I learn best by experimenting and creating small projects that help me understand the bigger picture. I like clear structure, good documentation, and simple workflows, and I’m also studying how AI works along with the engineering practices that support it — clean architecture, CI/CD, and integrated testing.

I’m currently looking for my first developer job, where I can apply what I’m learning, grow through hands-on experience, and contribute to a team that values clarity and steady improvement.
